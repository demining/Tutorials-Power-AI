2. Contextual Understanding: The tool is designed to understand context, which means it can provide more accurate and relevant answers based on the nuances of the user's questions.

## Classification of SearchGPT



SearchGPT can be classified into several categories based on its functionalities:



1. Conversational AI: It engages users in a dialogue, allowing for follow-up questions and clarifications, which enhances the overall user experience.



2. Information Retrieval: The primary function of SearchGPT is to retrieve information from a vast database, making it a valuable resource for research and learning.



3. Content Generation: Beyond search capabilities, SearchGPT can also generate text-based content, assisting users in drafting emails, reports, and other written materials.
